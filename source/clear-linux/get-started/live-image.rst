Install Clear Linux as a live image
###################################

A live image contains the complete |CLOSIA| operating system and resides
on a bootable media such as a USB drive or in a virtual machine
(see :ref:`virtual-machine-install`). This is a
great way to use |CL| without modifying your computer's hard disk.
